TODO:
- Use socket.io later. (Both client and server-side congruence)

einaros/ws project: Submit a fix?
https://github.com/einaros/ws/blob/master/lib/WebSocketServer.js
- if (!result) abortConnection(socket, 404, 'Unauthorized')

Chat:
- Use Node http to serve up static page as client; see if can run on same port as WS.
- Ajax endpoint to test if username is in use before login.
